# These exercises are designed to be done anytime after Tutorial #4 (units)

# # \# 1 Sun-Jupiter
# 
# Create a default binary Bundle, re-parameterize so that you can set both.  Now set the value of the masses and the respective radii such that you have a Jupiter around a Sun.
# 
# Hint: try using units to handle the conversion between Jupiter and Solar masses/radii.  You can always do dir(u) to see a list of all available units, or u.solMass.find_equivalent_units().  For other quantities (orbital/rotation periods, sma, etc), you may need to lookup the values since they do not have units/constants available.

# # \# 2 Sun-Earth
# 
# Create a Sun-Earth system.  Make sure to get the correct masses, radii, orbital period, separation, eccentricity, and rotational period.

# # \# 3 Detached Binaries
# 
# Pick a *detached* system from the [Caleb catalog of EBs](http://caleb.eastern.edu/query_stars_by_type.php), click on one of the "library sets", and then view the BM3 input file.  Try to translate as many of these parameters as you can into PHOEBE.  
# 
# Later we'll actually try to reproduce some of the light curve and radial velocity curves and learn how to handle semi-detached and contact systems.
