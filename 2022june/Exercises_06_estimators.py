# # Exercises #6: Estimators
# 
# These exercises are designed to be done anytime after the tutorial on estimators.
# 
# Download the following dataset files, attach to a default binary system, and run **estimators**  to try to find a decent fit to the observations.
# 
# * [lc.B.data](https://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-workshop/raw/2022june/data/dataset_exercises/lc.B.data) (times, fluxes, sigmas - Johnson B passband)
# * [lc.V.data](https://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-workshop/raw/2022june/data/dataset_exercises/lc.V.data) (times, fluxes, sigmas - Johnson V passband)
# * [rv1.data](https://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-workshop/raw/2022june/data/dataset_exercises/rv1.data) (times, rvs, sigmas for primary star)
# * [rv2.data](https://github.com/phoebe-project/phoebe2-workshop/raw/2022june/data/dataset_exercises/rv2.data) (times, rvs, sigmas for secondary star - same times as `rv1.data`, so feel free to merge into a single PHOEBE dataset)
