# PHOEBE Workshops

The master branch is intentionally left empty except for the built versions of ipynb and py files (which are managed by GitHub actions and built/copied to master so that they can be hosted by GitHub pages).  Each individual workshop can be found in its own branch and all content can be viewed from [phoebe-project.org/workshops](http://phoebe-project.org/workshops).  See [phoebe-project.org](http://phoebe-project.org) for the latest [documentation and tutorials](http://phoebe-project.org/tutorials) as well as announcements about [future workshops](http://phoebe-project.org/workshops).
