# # \# 1
# 
# Create a default binary Bundle, re-parameterize so that you can set one of the masses (**NOTE**: flipping both mass constraints isn't advised as it can cause some nasty infinite loops if you're not careful).  Now set the value of that mass, the mass-ratio (q), and the respective polar radii such that you have a Jupiter around a Sun.  Print the resulting mass@component and rpole@component values to check.
# 
# Hint: try using units to handle the conversion between Jupiter and Solar masses/radii.  You can always do dir(u) to see a list of all available units, or u.solMass.find_equivalent_units().  For other quantities (orbital/rotation periods, sma, etc), you may need to lookup the values since they do not have units/constants available.

# 
# Create a Sun-Earth system.  Make sure to get the correct masses, radii, orbital, distance, and rotational period.
