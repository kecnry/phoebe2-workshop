# These exercises are designed to be done anytime after Tutorial #10 (meshes)

# # \# 1
# 
# Try to make a plot/animation that illustrates the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect (i.e. show the RVs plotted as color on the meshes during eclipse as well as the synthetic RVs vs time).
# 
# Hints: 
# * you may be able to get a more exagerated example by changing certain Parameters of the system.
# * try only sampling from just before ingress to just after egress
#

# # \# 2
# 
# Take the same system you used above, and re-rerun the computations and plot/animation with rv_method='dynamical'.
# 
# Hints:
# * the 'rvs' won't be available in the mesh anymore, so either add/plot a different dataset, use 'vzs' instead, or skip plotting the 'rvs' on the mesh.
