It would make a great reference afterwards as well.,Yes,"Improve internet access (or eliminate firewall/port restrictions for things like SSH or the local websites) for those residing on campus. I had to switch between guest access (which allowed access to the PHOEBE website) and multimedia access (which allowed SSH). I did not have the same problem in Bartley Hall, but I was using EDUROAM there.",Maybe,4,Great workshop! Great people involved! Well worth the time (and money) for attendance!

However, some of us are still  mediocre in the use of PHOEBE, notwithstanding and may run into one problem or the other which may require the guidance of an expert.

It's really out of the purview of Phoebe, but a visual orbit solution module, or a wrapper for something akin to that would be a big wish list item!

9/12/2022 12:56:30,Yes,"JKTEBOP, ELC",7,3,5,1,5,2,All in-person,It sort of feels like the 'easier' portion of the workshop is in person and the part that is more challenging/requires more questions/requires personal interaction is online.  Maybe it would be possible to spend time working on the inverse problem in person with synthetic data?
