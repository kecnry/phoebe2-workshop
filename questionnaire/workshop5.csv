The coffee breaks were long enough to refresh ourselves between the lectures. So I think the schedule is fine as is.",,,7,No,"In most of the cases where I have encountered binaries, we either had a large sample of stars also including binaries, so case-by-case analysis was not feasible, or we had a too complicated multiple system. When a project including only one (simple) binary star comes up, I will happily use Phoebe.",Yes,4,Yes,"At our institute, we have multiple smaller servers (<100 cores, <100 GB RAM), but no large compute clusters.",No,5,"The preparation was really straightforward, I have never been to any other workshop with this few technical difficulties.",Yes,"One minor thing is that in many tutorials, it is hard for me to distinguish between built-in string keywords and user defined names. For example, in this line, I cannot tell whether 'ebai_mlp_est' is something I can freely change:
b.add_solver('estimator.ebai', ebai_method='mlp', solver='ebai_mlp_est')
For the tutorials, you could try to establish a specific convention for the user defined names, such as all caps, camel case or something easily recogniseable.",5,"It was hands-down the best summer school I have ever attended! The venue was perfect, the city was lovely, the lectures were awesome, and the sheer depth of your knowledge on the topic was frightening.
Also, Phoebe is not the kind of software one could master alone in an afternoon, so this workshop was really helpful for getting started. For me, even the complexity of the topic was unknown. It was really useful to see that a binary fitting software is not just a one-click tool that we can use on thousands of light curves without thinking.
So if possible, keep organizing these summer schools, I will recommend it to as many people as I can!"
9/22/2023 6:50:36,Yes,PHOEBE Legacy,5,3,2,4,5,"It is hard to say, because I have only several occasions of that kind of work shop, summer school. It was a good idea to have an extra hour on Monday in order to have the same version of Phoebe2.

There was a good balance between the talks and the tutorials. The amount of time for exercises was not enough, however. I know that the length of the workshop do not enable to deepen our knowledge/obtaining more experience for exploiting the capabilities of Phoebe2. On other hand, I could finish all the exercises (except for MCMC) at home.

Therefore I cannot suggest any advice how could you improve it. Perhaps with an additional week online, like one of the previous years.","I don't think, but I had the advantage self-learning a bit and using Phoebe2 before the workshop. The only thing I could think that the combinations of free parameters for fitting binary parameters. I mean, we could learn this year how could we flip the constraints technically. Naturally, there is a tutorial from a previous year covering this topic in question.",I think there isn't.,9,Almost,"A dedicated PC or server to run MCMC, but I am working on it. :'D",Yes,5,Yes,"Only my laptop (DELL Inspiron 7559, Intel Core i6700HQ 4 cores/8threads 3,5 GHz, 16GB RAM DDR3)
There is a possibility that my supervisor will update the OS of this computer, but this will not happen til I finish my PhD in the next 6 months (Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz, 16 GB RAM)",No,5,,Yes,,5,"Just a few comments:
 -> Although I gave 5 of 10 for the difficulty of workshop material, based on all the knowledge obtained during the workshop, we can solve the problems in the exercises. Just we need to take our time to figure it out. :) This is why I give 4 from 5 for covering the tutorials regarding solving the exercises.
 -> Sometimes there are surprising applications of PHOEBE2. At least for me. :) In one of my investigation, I had to check the LITE on pulsation signals occurring in an eccentric system I work on. At first, I wanted to use the experimental version of PHOEBE2 for direct simulations, but I was faced with a bug. So I calculated the orbit of the system and I utilized the proper coordinates to convert it to pulsation phase differences. It was fun to realize it. :)

Thank you very much again for organizing this wonderful Workshop. I hope to see you again. :)"

The PHOEBE team was very friendly and always available to answer questions. My previous interaction with the PHOEBE team was through GitHub, and I can say the same. The workshop was perfectly organized, and the team's concern for the participants was always evident. Thanks a lot. "
